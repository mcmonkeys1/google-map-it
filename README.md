#Google Map It
Another simple add-on I thought I would share. Inspired by the Map With Google addon, but working the way I want it to. Highlight an address with your mouse and right-click. Click on menu item "Google Map It" or press the letter 'g' key. A new tab opens with the selected text searched for in Google Maps.

Edit: I never actually uploaded this in the end to addons.mozilla.org as I fixed the issue and became a contributor of the original plugin, which can be found here (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/directions-with-google-maps/)
